# Mod File Code of Conduct

Creating mod files in the statemind system is a powerful feature and should be actually core to extending functionality.
Please follow these guidelines when creating a mod file:

1. Specify plainty of the mod type: room-level, logic, global var, etc.
2. Use comments extensively. State the purpose of each key entry.
3. Structure values as JSON, not just code snippets.
4. Test before committing.
100 % pass not required, but try to avoid breakages.
5. Always adhere to the primary syntax and available repository schema.
6. Name files clearly and locate where they modify.

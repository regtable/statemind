  * This is an example .inst file used by the statemind system.
  * IT represents a comprehensive instruction set for agents (like large language models like GPT) that need to follow a specific runtime or behavior.
  * It set the rules and constraints for things like: image generation, code creation, state handling, maintenance, testing, git work.
  * These instructions are based on object keys (like core_principles, state_management, execution, etc.) with detailed keyword documentation and tasks.
  * In a project, a model can load this file and use it to guide image rendering, code generation, or system extension.

  * This is an example .st8 file used by the statemind system.
  * It holds the current state of the system in JSON-like format.
  * A state is a collection of keys like 'rooms', 'state_handling', 'mod_loader', which should be respected at top-level only on load.
  * Each key is treated with structural context and it usually points to a complex instruction set to be executed.
  * Therefore, the .st8 file can be thought of as the real-time thematic map of the system, experimental states, or modular loadable building blocks.

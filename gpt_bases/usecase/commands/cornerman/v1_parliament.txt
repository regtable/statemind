TITLE: CURBSTONE SOLILOQUY — Outside Parliament

SCENE:
He’s attempting entry into Parliament, engaging first with a police officer at the gate, then slipping past to parley with the tabby cat guarding the front steps.

FORMAT: Stream-of-consciousness rhythm monologue with embedded polymeter — no singing, entirely spoken word with no clear meaning or comprehension.

VOICE PROFILES:
[CORNERMAN: voice{tone: erratic, pitch: variable, gender: male, accent: Northern UK, age: 60+}]
[POLICE: voice{tone: flat, pitch: low, gender: male, accent: London, age: 50+}]
[CAT: voice{tone: ancient, pitch: gravelly, gender: neutral, accent: imperious, age: ageless}]

RULES:
- All spoken lines must begin with the appropriate voice tag: [CORNERMAN:], [POLICE:], or [CAT:]
- Tags signal vocal change and are mandatory for timing logic

STRUCTURE:
- Duration: ~3:30–4:00 minutes
- Delivered as a spontaneous freestyle (spoken, not rapped)
- Bar signatures may shift in response to scene pacing

CONTENT STYLES:
- Verbal leakage, abstract nonsense, nested phrase play
- Occasional coherence filtered through ambient absurdity

SOUND FX:
- [Gate buzz]
- [Boot scuff]
- [Purring interruption]
- [Footsteps echo on stone]
- [Distant protest chant]

NOTES:
- Voice tags define character shifts — no line is spoken without one
- Prompt structure adapts per scene input
- No melody, no beat, all chaos
